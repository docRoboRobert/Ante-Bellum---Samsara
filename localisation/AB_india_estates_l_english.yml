 estate_tamil_guilds_desc:0 "Tamil Guilds are present throughout all of Tamil Nandu region but their influence streatches much further. For centuries, they have been a dominant merchant caste in all of Coromandel, amassing great wealth from commerce. Tamils have found many guilds, on the coast and in central lands, focused on exchanging and producting exotic goods that are then shipped west, towards the Middle East. Naval and economic strength the Tamil guilds hold over the region, allowed them to elevate themselves above lower merchants and establish themselves as commercial and political powerhouse that must be reckoned with."

 estate_tamil_guilds_indebted_to_tamils_desc:0 "Tamil Guilds offer us extra monetary help in form of favourable loans. We can ask to borrow some money from them in exchange for political influence but this would also drain their reserves and cause a slow-down in the economy."

Whether it is pirates, robbers, enemy bands, privateers or rowdy citizens, it is the duty of the state to protect its merchants. Since Tamil Guilds have always been capable and powerful, we can allow them to recruit and upkeep small army forces, loyal to them, so that they may protect themselves from threats. This way Tamils can enforce order locally more effectively than central state and we won't have to invest so heavily in guarrison checks. On the other hand, allowing a powerful estate to hire private military will grant them massive leverage and may lead to consequences if we aren't careful."

Their scholars have embraced Lhasan Tibetan as the language of governance and learning, though their own dialects remain distinct, shaped by generations of local heritage. With a history of administration and commerce unmatched in the known world, the Gya continue to serve as governors, traders, and scholars, ensuring the flow of wealth and order across the land. While some cling to the ways of the past, many see this era as one of renewal, a chance to build a society founded on stability and wisdom. As the Dharma spreads, so too does the influence of the Gya, their customs shaping the empire just as the empire reshapes them."

Though the imperial dynasties have fallen, their administrators remain, adapting to the new order while continuing to manage taxation, governance, and public works. By integrating the Gya civil administration into the state, we benefit from their expertise while ensuring that governance aligns with the Dharma.

The Gya merchant guilds, in cooperation with monastic administrators, have established an intricate network of grain routes to ensure that surplus harvests reach the cities, monasteries, and armies that depend on them. Caravans laden with rice and wheat move swiftly along well-maintained roads and rivers, while temple granaries act as emergency reserves in times of crisis. Though this system ensures stability and prosperity, it also shifts economic power into the hands of those who control the flow of food.
