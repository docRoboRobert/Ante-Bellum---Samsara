 cb_chakravartin_order_crusade_desc:0 "The Chakravartin is not merely a ruler—he is the sacred force that turns the Wheel of Dharma, guiding the world toward enlightenment. Yet, so long as lands remain outside the Dharma's reach, suffering persists, and the cycle of ignorance endures. It is the duty of the faithful to break these chains, to bring wisdom where there is darkness, and to end the rule of false kings who reject the path of liberation."
