 jain_routes_new:0 "Jain Connections"
 jain_routes_new_desc:0 "Jainism is an ancient way of life, put into its current form by Mahavira (599 BCE – 527 BCE). For a thousand years, Gujarat has been the stronghold of the Jain community and faith, with many holy sites and temples. Royal dynasties have patronized the religion, forming a common community with Hindus. Jain majority and ruling Hindu elite co-existed for centuries. Mongol and Ilkhanate invasions from the northwest, in 13th and 14th century, oppressed the Jaina community, vandalizing temples or converting them into dens of decadence, as well as having burned Jaina libraries. However, the Jains of Gujarat have survived, adapted and prospered, using their connections with Jain communities across the world to serve as a hub for both the faith and commerce."
