 abindia_shitevent.1.t:0 "What do you think you're doing?"
 abindia_shitevent.1.d:0 "In case you haven't noticed, this nation isn't supposed to be played by the player. \n \nParmistan is a meme tag added as a placeholder to replace Timurid Empire before the upcoming Ante Bellum Persia Update. The non-existance of Timurid nation is vital for the India Expansion mod's lore, therefore such decision was made. \n \nAs this nation is just a placeholder, do not expect any flavour content besides what you've already seen. No unique events nor goals. \n \nIf you realized your mistake, please reload the game and try to play actual nation instead. \n \nYou're still reading this aren't you? Listen, it's an empty tag to fill in the void left by necessary removal of Timurids. That's it. AI is supposed to play this nation for a while and then (hopefully) get conquered before disrupting the balance of cosmos. \n \nThis isn't lore-accurate at all. Stop looking. \n \nOh, you're reading till the end expecting some sort of crazy twist? Nuh uh... \n \nCome on, just return to the main menu. That's it! You've made a mistake. Time to move on. \n \n... \n \nThe code to immortality orb is 2751094"

 abindia_shitevent.2.t:0 "Mountain Host of Parmalionid Clan"
 abindia_shitevent.2.d:0 "The ancient folk legends tell the tale of ominous tribal host secluded deep within the hostile, deserted valleys of Western Sagestan Mountains. Local peasants share stories of great demigod-like warriors leading a prophetic state that remains elusive to normal people trying to reach it. Only the devoted and righteous will ever arrive at its gates. Unworthy shall be destined to perish on scorching desert. Legends also mention insane craftsmanship and knowledge of its inhabitants. They hold the secretly-developed technology and army of master-level warriors that the nation guards from the eyes of commoners. The nation, led by the chosen lineage of Parmalionid family, will remain dormant, slowly building its strength, protecting its secrets, until the time is right to rise. It is said that when the day great "update" is released upon mankind, all of its wraith, might and power will spew out of Sagestan into the world, led by their almighty king. It is unknown what entity - natural, cosmic or unnatural - has granted this state keys to great treasure. Most folks state that it was ancient deity known as RN-Geezus that has blessed the chosen ones of the region to form this secret society and purge the continent once the prophecy is fulfilled. Why the deity did so remains unknown, supposedly it became disgusted after witnessing the greed and cruelty of ancient kings and wanted to punish the rulers of the Earth for being unjust and tyrant. \nWhatever the legends say, we have learnt that the lowborns of the eastern parts of our nation have been spreading unrest and disdain among our people. Apparently, the time for the mythical nation to rise is just now. We need to respond to those rumors accordingly."

 abindia_shitevent.3.d:0 "The legends are all real!! \nThe supposedly removed and fictional Permistan no longer remains dormant within unreachable mountains of Sagestan! The mystical state has risen by some, supposedly otherwordly, intervention and its ready to wreck havoc over the Persia like it was foretold in the legends. The state led by the Parmalionid dynasty will soon reveal its intentions towards the world. Most rulers and citizens can barely process what has even happened... \n.It's really hard to believe... unthinkable really... but it's live and its allegiance to Shapurids is only formal."
 abindia_shitevent.3.a:0 "And so it begins..."
 abindia_shitevent.3.tooltip1:0 "§gindia_shitevent.3.tooltip1:0 The time has come to unleash upon the world your immense hatred towards mission trees. Good luck with your invasion. The world will not take kindly your domineering ambitions... though what can they do but weep in anger?§!"
 abindia_shitevent.4.t:0 "The Great March on Harew"
 abindia_shitevent.4.d:0 "Parmistan has risen and with that its great army has risen too! Led by the divine ruler - Anton Bellukh - they begin their great march towards Harew. The city was prophesied to be taken by the army of otherwordly warriors during the days of The Update and its walls set to become the new capital from which Anton will begin its righetous venture against the rest of the world. Right now the banners have been rallied and the army is marching on towards the promised city, with Anton Bellukh on its front. Shapurids whom previously held control over the region, have lost any control over Parmistan and its leaders. Great things are about to unfold."

 abindia_shitevent.6.t:0 "Strong Base Secured"
 abindia_shitevent.6.d:0 "Parmistan has successfully consolidated its starting region and secured a decent base of operation for further missions. New government has been properly established and new order is being brought to the conquered lands. With our domain large enough, proper administrative structures can take care of the realm while the army and leadership will focus on continiuing our expansion."
 abindia_shitevent.6.a:0 "Soon the world will be purged of all mission trees."

 abindia_shitevent.7.t:0 "Centralized Government Established"
 abindia_shitevent.7.d:0 "With enough time having passed and enough land conquered under our glorious rule, Parmistan can finally declare itself as highly-functional entity. The successful conquests of Anton Bellukh and his successors have elevated him to the rank of god-like figure. Now no man has any doubt whose power is all-reaching and undisputed. The Emperor of Parm now sits on the throne and plots future moves with the trusted war cabinet."
 abindia_shitevent.7.a:0 "Increase production of thighs and ban event previews!"
 abindia_shitevent.7.tooltip1:0 "§VThis is the last scripted event for this obscure tag. From now on, you are free to write your own story. Just don't expect any more unique events.§!"
 abindia_shitevent.8.t:0 "Dodo Birds of Mauritius"
 abindia_shitevent.8.d:0 "We have recently established a growing colony on the island of Mauritius. Some unusual sight has caught the attention of the settlers. It seems that the island is home to unique species of flightless birds. Those clumsy and silly-looking birds were given the name of 'Dodo'. Unlike regular birds, they appear to be completely harmless and defenceless. Dodo birds do not posess any fear of predators, allowing humans to quite literally hunt them by just picking them off the ground. This interesting phenomena has only been seen on Mauritius and it's likely that the birds are endemic only to this place. The farmers cherish as they've just unlocked a source of the easiest pray to boost colony's growth but it's also clear that those giant fearless chickens will quickly go extinct if we let that happen."
 abindia_shitevent.8.a:0 "Excellent, more easy meat to feed the pupulation!"
 abindia_shitevent.8.b:0 "We must protect and study those birds at all cost!"
 
 #Country-specific lore dump events on start
 abindia_starting_lore.1.t:0 "Remnants of Persian Hind"
 abindia_starting_lore.1.d:0 "Hind is a Persian word describing area of Indus River Valley and potentially all of India. Ever since the antique times Hind meant the easternmost satrapy of the Persian Empire. Much like now in the last century, in the early medieval era Indus River Valley was a constant back-and-forth contested ground between Persian Leaders trying to stretch their rule and local Hindu dynasties breaking free in times of trouble. This struggle culminated in 11th century when Sassanid Persia launched major (failed) invasion on Gujarat which only managed to establish small satrapy on the right bank of Indus. Nonetheless, Hind satrapy was very successful (more successful than Sassanid overlords who were very quickly conquered by Seljuks) at spreading Zoroastrianism and persianizing Hindu population. Growth of Hind was quickly ended by the rise of Mongols who first conquered north in 1258. The southern remnants of Hind were then overran by first Ilkhanate invasion of 1272, thus ending Persian rule in Hind for good. Ilkhanate would dominate the area for the next 100 years, followed by Black Khanate, and after its demise, Punjab Kingdom. Despite century of foreign rule, half of the Sindh area has been already persianized and converted to Zoroastrianism and so the pro-Persian sentiment has never been extinguished. Collapse of Black Khanate's might allowed for a brief Sindh rise which was quelled by Punjab. The breaking of Punjab at the turn of 15th century not only created a power vacuum for rump states, it also allowed pro-Persian elite of Hind to rise up and seize right bank of Indus where Sassanids once ruled. Many small wars with Sindh followed with neither side gaining upper hand. As such, organic border between us and our adversaries formed along the river. In 1444 Hind satrapy still holds on to its territory, governed by decayed Persian sentiment and definitely on the weaker end of states. Hind leaders must exploit the ongoing total collapse of centralized rule throughout India or else it will quickly be absorbed by its stronger neighbors. \nIsolated from Persia that is currently divided between waring factions, Hind in 1444 must secure itself from Balochi tribes raiding from the mountains, rising threat of Greek impersonators to the north and hostility from Jainist Sindh. While Thatta port city may be the biggest trading harbour in Indus Valley, it's also prime target to seize by maritime powers. There's a long journey ahead for persianized hindu state to reclaim the full might of past centuries."
 abindia_starting_lore.1.a:0 "We will not be conquered again!"
 abindia_starting_lore.1.tooltip:0 "§VWith the current turmoil in Persia, we are relatively separated from their politics and vice-versa. As such, we have free reign over our policies and goals in the region. That is only temporary though. When (and if) Persia puts itself back together, it will surely seek a formal acknowledgement of their rule over eastern territories...§!"
 abindia_starting_lore.2.t:0 "Monastic city-state of Lhasa"
 abindia_starting_lore.2.d:0 "Lhasa is a powerful and well-developed city-state, stretching its power over the valley it's located in. Being the most developed (and in 1444 the only) urban region in Tibet brings prestige and wealth. Its wealth comes at a price though. For centuries Vajrayana Buddhism has been slowly making its way into Tibetan Plateau which followed Bön since atiquity. As such, Buddhism has been slowly entrenching itself in eastern parts of Tibet to the anger of Bön tribes westwards. In 1444 Lhasa is an epicentre of the Bön-Vajrayana conflict and is considered a frontier stronghold to further Buddhist expansion. Before Lhasa was seized by council of Buddhist figures and grew substantially in 14th century, it was home to many Bön monasteries and clans. These old inhabitants remain in Lhasa to this day, forming religious majority only governed by small Buddhist elite. Naturally, this lead to many instances of civil unrest. In 1444 a fragile peace is kept as a result of few religious treaties signed years prior. It is a fragile peace, as Buddhist theocrats has grown more corrupt and power-hungry in later years, mostly due to rapid rise of revenue coming from city's development. Buddhist zealots, blinded by their sense of divine mission, will seek to extend their theocratic rule and push the frontier further west, at the cost of heathens. To the south and east one may find tribal kingdoms of Sakya and U-Tsang which adopted buddhism earlier. To the west, Bön tribes and monasteries entrench themselves, awaiting for opportunity to turn the tide. Theocratic monarchs governing Lhasa have dreamt for decades to defeat Bön pagans from Tsurphu and burn down their monastry. In the coming decade it shall all be settled - whether Lhasa crumbles under its own dissatisfied population or emerges victorious and embarks on new holy crusade against its many neighbours. The theocratic elite turns ever more unhinged with each passing year..."
 abindia_starting_lore.2.a:0 "Frontier must be pushed further"
 abindia_starting_lore.2.tooltip:0 "§YKeep stability positive until Lhasa is free of old faith or else its citizens will rise up against your despotic rule.§!"

Banquet is a splendorous festival aimed bring more unity and kindness between different Malankara countries. Joining this charitable event will surely be a great opportunity to make important connections, gather new friends and display our piety. Whilst great image boost, sending our trusted men to be surrounded by all sorts of people in foreign territory is a risky action nonetheless."

The guests who took part in it are now leaving the capital happy, while we can make use of the in-put effort."
 malankara_aspect_events.3.a:0 "Glory to us!"
 malankara_mission_events.1.t:0 "Missionaries arrive from [From.GetName]"
 malankara_mission_events.1.d:0 "It appears that the ruler of [From.GetName] - [From.Monarch.GetName] - has decided to continue early Christian missions and sent a large amount St. Thomas' followers to our realm. The true goal of this action can only be guessed but it's clear they aren't here to conduct diplomacy with the court. They are here, to nobody's surprise, to ask for permission, so they may freely conduct their religous goal without the fear of being persecuted. They claim they do not mean any harm and are here only because of their god's will. They also claim that it is within our religion' teachings to tolerate them and if our population is truly faithful to our gods, they will simply ignore them. As much as it is concerning, they do appear to only be interested in establishing communities and spreading the message of their god. As such, it is now our only opportunity to decide whether we let them in or throw them out."

 malankara_mission_events.2.t:0 "Mission to [From.GetName] is a success"
 malankara_mission_events.2.d:0 "Our missionaries have succeeded. They have been allowed to freely conduct their conversion mission within the [From.GetName]'s borders. We've gained trust and goodwill of their leaders, which allowed them to spread the word of God. In the outcome, so many people were baptised, that new bishopric had to be established, new churches erected and one of the provinces of that nation now follows the Malankara scripture. If he could see it, St. Thomas would be very proud of us!"
 malankara_mission_events.2.a:0 "Glorious day for our church"
 malankara_mission_events.3.t:0 "Mission to [From.GetName] is a failure"
 malankara_mission_events.3.d:0 "Curse! Our missionaries sent to [From.GetName] were not allowed to enter and freely conduct their work. Leadership of the nation saw our efforts as dangerous and conspiratorial and thus the missionaries were thrown out of the country. They are now returning with empty hands and broken morale."
 malankara_mission_events.3.a:0 "Shame, let's hope future attempts give better results"
 malankara_mission_events.4.t:0 "Malankara pressure grows out of control"
 malankara_mission_events.4.d:0 "Due to the work of Christian missionaries and their constant pursuit of new followers, Malankara religion has gradually grown to be the dominant faith practised within our nation. As Christian dominance grows substantially, many of our citizens and high-rank officials begin to question our old ways. They pressure our ruleship that it's high time to embrace the new God and add our realm to the organized world of Christendom. Malankara missionaries, which were sent here recently, claim that if the leader decided to convert to Christianity, they can take care of the details and ensure the change of beliefs is going to be peaceful and stable."

 #Mission events
 abindia_mission.1.t:0 "Expedition to Lakshadweeps"
 abindia_mission.1.d:0 "To the north of Maldives lies another chain of tiny islands known as Lakshadweeps. Those tiny rocks west of Malabar coast were known and inhabited by the locals since antiquity. Due to their size and insignificane, nobody has yet made any effort of establishing permanent rule over there. For centuries islands served as stop and resupply hub for merchants and travellers. The locals, despite adopting Islam thanks to Ubaidullah in 661 CE, still live in free stateless society. As our pirate republic seeks expansion, claiming those islands for the black flag would be a perfect beginning. Not to mention that once within our hands, those islands would make a perfect naval base to organize pirate raids on Western Indian Coast. \nIntegrating the islands permanently to our republic won't be an easy task though. Land there is mostly empty and unsustainable. First settlers to arrive there to establish administrative structures would require constant flow of supplies from Maldives before building enough infrastructure to support basic fishing economy.But once it's done, we can expect it to serve as excellent naval base. It is a mission worth consideration."

Terrirories of which reach deep indland, which may pose difficulties in governing it as a pirate state. We must also consider native population living on the island and local noble class which definetely will not be happy with our radical anti-monarchic views. Shall we liberate the population from their masters or let them remain slaves to their overlords? Shall we directly control the land for future exploitation or leave it to its own and only set on the coast? We must decide before we continue our endeavours."

The others say that we are simply not ready to face slave market this size and its scale will simply overwhelm us. That we are not prepared nor even aware of the future consequences such reliance of slave workforce would cause.

They've gained trust of local governors that were subverted by the potential revenue from piracy and influenced our nation greatly. \nNow we shall take an action whilst we still can. The pirate factions have already gained strong support. Many of our people don't mind forming official comitees to coordinate common actions.

The location is extremely remote, thousends of kilometres from inhabited mainland. The two tiny islands stand out as two lanters of hope in the middle of nowhere. They are separated by about 55km of ocean - northern, larger one, has some suitable ground for an outpost, - southern, smaller one, is very rough with steep cliffs. \nSouthern island was named Puthiyakotte by our explorers. It's entirely grasslands and rockhopper penguins being its main inhabitants. Puthiyakotte is a volcanic island with a triangular shape that measures no more than 5 km at its widest point. It is the top of an active volcano and is rocky with steep cliffs on the east side. Active thermal springs have been found here. It appears to be an important breeding site for seabirds of all kinds. \nNorthern island has been given the name of Dangal. The island is a potentially active volcano. It has an area of 56.6km2, being an oval is shape and measuring about 10 km on its longest side, and reaches as high as 867m at the central peak. The high central area of the island, at an elevation of over 500 metres, containing its peaks and caldera, is a flat plateau covered in grasslands with few dwarf trees. The northwestern coast of the island is flatter, being prime spot for a base. Much like southern island, it's home to countless birds, including penguins. \n \nBoth islands have mild oceanic climate with 20C summers and winters never dropping below 5C. It's the warmest and most hospitable out of all islands that lie below Cape's latitude."

The voyage and landing was very tough. The treacherous winds blow high year-round and the site is covered in clouds for most of the year. To the surprise of the sailors, climate on the islands is harsh and cold despite being in temperate zone of 46 degrees south. It's very likely that some massive source of ice is blowing cold air to this island year-round (could this be hypothetical Antarctica manifesting its wraith?). \nThe southern, larger one - named Mekhaavruthamaaya (Cloudy Island) -  is 25km long and 16,6km wide with an area of 297km2 and a coastline of some 72km, most of which is high cliffs. The highest point on the island reaches 1,242m as is a peak of volcano. The topography of Marion Island includes many hillocks and small lakes, and boggy lowland terrain with little vegetation. \nThe northern, smaller one - Kaattulla (Windy Island) - is much smaller at only 46km2, 10,2km long and 6,6km wide, and lies some 22 km to the north-east of Mekhaavruthamaaya. The terrain is generally rocky, with high cliffs on its south-western side. The highest peak in north-west of the center reaches a height of 672m and the entire island is scattered with numerous active volcanoc mounds. \nBoth islands are of volcanic origin. Bare rock and gravel around central volcanic mounds gradually transitions into trundra grasslands on its shores. Oceanic climate creates very low temperature difference of 9C in summer and 4C in winter. Just like with all islands of this kind, the primary inhabitants are birds that use it as nesting grounds. The island is too small, infertile and cold to sustain any permanent population. At best, a hunting-repair station might be established on its shores. Nonetheless, the discovery of those islands is impressive achievement for naval development."

Maldive explorers, who recently discovered Mekhaavruthamaaya and Kaattulla Islands, kept sailing east around the same latitude and sumbled upon this new archipelago. The voyage and landing was very tough and uncertain. Much like the previous islands they've just discovered, climate on the archipelago is harsh and tundra-like despite being in temperate zone of 46 degrees south. It's very likely that some massive source of cold way down south is causing massive streams of cold air to his this latitudes year-round. The archipelago consists of 3 major islands and 2 clumps of small islands scattered to the north and the south. The newly discovered chain has been given a name - Albatariq - meaning Penguin Islands in Arabic. As the name implies, the pirates who first landed on one of the islands spotted a large flock of those flightless birds building nests all over its cliffs. Local penguin population amazed adventurers who named the entire chain after them. Besides numerous species of penguins, large groups of seals and elephant seals were found on the islands. \nOceanic tundra climate present on the islands reveals bare rocks and mounds of volcanic origin. Despite islands clearly being formed by eruptions, the voyagers found no signs of active volcanism. Similar to previous dicoveries, temperatures are stable in the cold range, going from 11C in summer and 3C in winter. Steep cliffs and treacherous beaches make landing on most of the islands only possible in few places. Those who decide to land on one will only see tundra-like grasslands, mosses, naked rocks and gravel piles. All 3 major island are also mountainous with peaks going above 750m. The highest one, being on eastermost island, reaches 1090m. None of the islands or even islands combined can sustain permanent settlements but hunting base could be established."

This is by far the largest island discovered south of Madagascar. Maldive explorers, with access to new, more durable ships, kept departing from African Cape and after reaching lower and lower latitudes, sailed eastward looking for new lands. At last, at 49 degrees south and thousends of miles of cold empty ocean, a land was spotted. The formation consists of big central island, about three-quarters of the size of Corsica, and is surrounded by a further 300 smaller islands and islets, forming an archipelago of 7215km2. The central island as well as the whole archipelago has been given a name - Vijanamaayadveepa - Desolate Island. \nAs the name implies, explorers who first visited the island described is as cold, empty wasteland - with grassy tundra near the coast and barren volcanic rocks on the slops. There is also large glacier covering highlands in the western part of the island. Strong winds from the west blow almost constantly year-round. The only place suitable for human life seems to be its eastern side which is shielded from storms and free of ice. Oceanic tundra climate present on the island causes the temperatures to stay between 2C - 9C year-round. Plant life is mainly limited to grasses, mosses, and lichens, although the islands are also known for the indigenous, edible species of cabbage, a good source of vitamin C to mariners. The main indigenous animals are insects along with large populations of ocean-going seabirds, seals, and penguins."

Using the latest naval technology, the crew would set sail southward and continue until 60 degress south where icy conditions grew too harsh, then returning and spiraling back to the outpost. \nFinally, after weeks of traversing arctic waters, on [GetDate] and at 53 degress south a land has been found - the southern-most piece of land on the entire Indian Ocean. 2 snowy islands were spotted, separated by about 44km as well as few tiny islets, below 1km2 in surface, scattered around. Both of them are covered in permanent snow layer and glacier, with only small bits hosting grass clumps. The whole chain falls under extreme case of oceanic tundra, with constant near-zero temperatures of 0,4C - 5C year-round. \nThe smaller, western island was given the name 'Paara' meaning 'rock'. Being only 2,5km2 in size, it is an active volcano rising 186m above sea level and covered in snow cap. It has flat, grassy beaches, which will most likely vanish with next eruption. A large colony of penguins was observed among the grasses. \nThe largest, eastern island was named 'Veluthadveepa' meaning 'White Island'. With the size of 368km2, it dwarfs all the other islands in comparison. Island is very mountainous with one very steep mountain dominating the landscape. The height of its peak being 2745m shocked voyagers but made the island visible from very far away. No previously discovered arctic island had mountain this high. It is also fully covered in glacier. In fact, 80% of Veluthadveepa is covered in ice. Just like Paara island, it is also geologically active but on much bigger scale and its volcanic summit, to which the average ascent from shore is steeper than that for any island of comparable size or larger, has erupted, spawning lava flows which, as observed by the crew, 'melted large swats of ice cover and resulted in a large pillar of steam forming'. \nOne landing attempt on the Veluthadveepa was made but it was unsuccessful due to harsh weather, so for few days the crew had to limit themselves to observing the islands before conditions worsened and they returned to Madagascar to report of their great finding.

Newly disovered continent of Australia offers immense resources and production base but the terrain requires development and its native population is small. Once there was no more Aboriginals to enslave, African slaves had to be imported from coast of East Africa. Their slave labour allowed massive mines and plantations to develop in Australia. Exotic goods produced in Australia were shipped north and, combined with trade from Moluccas, exported to India. India, from where colonial overlords govern Australia, then further refines exotic goods and ships them to Arabia. Arab merchants then sell it off to Europeans while investing the profits into slave trade in East Africa. Thus, the trapezoid of commerical exchange is closed.
