 jainism: "Jain"
 jainism_religion_desc:0 "Jainism, also known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four Tirthankaras (supreme preachers of Dharma), with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, dated to the 9th century BCE, and the twenty-fourth tirthankara Mahavira, around 600 BCE. Jainism is considered to be an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahimsa (non-violence), anekantavada (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (asceticism)."

 digambara_school:0 "Digambara"
 digambara_school_desc:0 "Digambara is one of the two major schools of Jainism. The Sanskrit word Digambara means "sky-clad", referring to their traditional monastic practice of neither possessing nor wearing any clothes. Digambara followers cherish the virtue of non-attachment and non-possession of any material goods. Monks carry a community-owned picchi, which is a broom made of fallen peacock feathers for removing and thus saving the life of insects in their path or before they sit. \n \nSome key aspects of Digambara include: \n- Asceticism \n- Pacifism \n- Ritual Hospitality \n- Rejection of clothing"
 svetambara_school:0 "Svetambara"
 svetambara_school_desc:0 "Svetambara is the other of two main branches of Jainism. Svetambara means "white-clad", and refers to its ascetics' practice of wearing white clothes, which sets it apart from the Digambara "sky-clad" Jains, whose ascetic practitioners go nude. Followers do not believe that ascetics must practice nudity. \n \nSome key aspects of Svetambara include: \n- Asceticism \n- Pacifism \n- Monasticism \n- White Clothing"
 yapaniya_school:0 "Yapaniya"
 yapaniya_school_desc:0 "Yapaniya is less-popular branch of Jainism originating from the same schizm as previous schools. Yapaniya was a Jain order in western Karnataka. It follows many rites similar to Digambara, such as asceticism or lack of clothing, while allowing for higher role of women in society. Yapaniya followers allow women to hold priestly and religious position and also making poverty a virtue. \n \nSome key aspects of Svetambara include: \n- Asceticism \n- Pacifism \n- Vows of Poverty \n- Rejection of clothing \n- Equal position of gender"
 bhumivastra_school:0 "Bhumivastra"
 bhumivastra_school_desc:0 "Bhumivastra is relatively-new and controversial branch of Jainism originating from the theological works of disillusioned Sindhi and Gujarati radicals in the aftermath of horrific Mongol Invasions. The bloodshed and ruin numerous Mongol invasions brought to Western India and the frustraiting inability of authorities to protect its followers radicalized Jain population and pushed them to gradually reconsider their view of the world. The new school was gradually established in Sindh around 1320 - 1330. The main center of controversy is their rejection of ahimsa (vow of non-violence), which is instead replaced by concept of "necessary protection". The idea teaches that violence is only justifiable if it's done for defence against foreign agression and excusable if it's done for protection of opressed brethren. Other schools criticise that this idea is easily abused by ruling class to wage wars. Besides that, it follows many rites similar to baseline Jainism, such as asceticism and humble life. Followers of Bhumivastra, which means "Ground-clad" wear brown and green clothing to reflect their "grounded view of reality" and connection to nature. It also allows for higher role of women in society, like Yapaniya does, but this stems from times of Mongol opression in which women were forced to take on many roles that dead men could not fill. \n \nSome key aspects of Svetambara include \n- Asceticism \n- Rejection of pacifism for necessary violence \n- Vows of humble lifestyle \n- Brown and green clothing \n- Limited equality of gender"
