As the Wheel-Turning Monarch, the Chakravartin does not merely govern; he guides all under heaven toward enlightenment, enforcing righteousness through both wisdom and power. This system of governance retains the administrative structures of the Middle Kingdom, allowing for efficient rule over vast lands while ensuring that all officials act in accordance with Buddhist principles.

Its rulers are not hereditary kings nor elected officials, but fearsome warrior-abbots, hand-selected by the Dalai Lama himself for their unmatched martial skill, tactical brilliance, and unshakable faith. From their fortified monasteries, these battle-hardened monks train in both the art of war and the path to enlightenment, wielding the sword and sutra in equal measure. Though they govern their own lands, they are sworn to eternal service, their armies marching at the Chakravartin's command. For them, conquest is not for plunder or power—it is the sacred duty of those who would end suffering by bringing all beings under the Dharma's rule."
